# Train ML model in IBM

After creating a model in localhost we need to create and deploy the model in the IBM cloud. First we need an API Key to communicate with IBM cloud and we need to train,test our model in jupter notebook in IBM Watson. Then we need to create and deploy model in Cloud Strorage.

# Integrating Flask with Scoring Endpoint

After deploying the model in IBM cloud we need to connect to the storage with API keys and change the scoring end point. With the help of API we need to send the Extracted URL values to the model in the IBM Cloud and we will get the prediction of the model in the response.
